# Pandas Library Notes
This is my work-in-progress personal notes for the pandas library for Python.  

## Requirements
This notes uses pandas 2.0 library and the 2022 stackoverflow dev survey ([download survey](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2022.zip))

## TODO
- pandas_01 split into a and b (old pandas_01 is now pandas_01b). Create note on Series and DataFrame structures on pandas_01a.
- Convert comments to md for pandas_02 and pandas_03
